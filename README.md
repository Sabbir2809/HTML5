### I'm learning Full-Stack Web Development. It's a 365-Day Challenge. I want to share with all of you what I have learned from this topic.

- HTML is the language behind every website on the Internet! It's a markup language used to define the structure and content of web pages. It's the first language you need to learn if you want to become a web developer.
